# HTMLScraper
My first attempt to use python to scrape html code from websites and process the data.
As an academic investigation, craigslist was used to test this code, but this script is not designed nor should it be used to scrape craigslist. 
This program is open source for learning purposes and should not be misconstrued as distributing software violating Craigslist terms of use.
